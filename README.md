Fully responsive design using Bootstrap's grid system and custom media queries.
Semantic HTML5 for accessibility and proper structure.
Mobile-first approach in CSS development.
Optimized and responsive images using the <picture> element.
Accessible features like alt text for images, ARIA roles, and skip links.
Customized Bootstrap variables for colors, typography, and spacing.
Hover and focus states for buttons and links with smooth transitions.

Process
Planning:

I created the design for three pages (Home, About, and Projects) using Figma, ensuring responsiveness for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
A wireframe was created to finalize the structure and layout.
Development:

The site is built using the Bootstrap 5.3.0 framework.
I ensured semantic HTML5 structure for all pages for readability and SEO optimization.
All text content was written by me, and I created or optimized the images for the site.
Challenges:

Image Responsiveness: It was tricky to use the <picture> element effectively. I overcame this by reading the documentation and testing multiple configurations to ensure images scaled properly.
Customizing Bootstrap: Adjusting Bootstrap variables required careful attention to detail, especially for typography and colors. I resolved this by studying the Bootstrap documentation and using CSS variables.
Accessibility: Ensuring ARIA roles and skip links work as intended required additional validation and testing.
Validation:

HTML code was validated using W3C HTML Validator.
CSS was validated using W3C CSS Validator.

The importance of planning responsive designs from the start using a mobile-first approach.
